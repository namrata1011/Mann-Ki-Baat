Dear I have an idea for optimal use of caste based reservation system. I think government should give some kind of card based card or certificate in two copies to all SC ST in 3 years time from start of execution date.

Then they will be general category.

Dear I have an idea for optimal use of caste based reservation system. I think government should give some kind of card based card or certificate in two copies to all SC ST in 3 years time from start of execution date.

Then they will be general category.
