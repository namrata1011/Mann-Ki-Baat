# Mann-Ki-Baat
Sentiment Analysis
PM Modi hosts an Indian radio programme called Mann Ki Baat in which he addresses the people of the namtion on All India radio, DD national and DD news.
People can interact, discuss and deliberate their issues on mygov.in which can be later discussed by the PM in this program.

The problem is to get the crisp information out of these oosted issues and get an idea of what the majority of public demands to be discussed in the next speech.

By using NLP (Natural Language Processing) and sentiment analysis on the dataset extracted from the public sources, we can get the desired solution.

This project is in starting phase. Contributions are invited.
